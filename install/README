Cornfed SIP User Agent Installation

To install the Cornfed SIP User Agent, perform the following steps:

1. Unpack the tarball.  This should result in a directory called
   'cornfedsipua'.  Change into that directory.

2. Make sure the install script file 'install.sh' is executable.  This
   can be done by executing the following command:

   chmod u+x install.sh

3. You may need to edit the default path in the install.sh script.  Some
   distributions place the Gnome files in the /opt/gnome.  If this is the
   case, change the PREFIX variable in install.sh from "/usr" to
   your default path.

4. As root, execute the install script by typing following command:

   ./install.sh

When this procedure is complete, you should have a menu item for the
Gnome client in you network group: Applications -> Network (or
Applications -> Internet).  You can start the Command Line Interface
(CLI) client by typing the following command in a terminal:

   cornfedsip_cli

To remove an installation, perform the following steps:

1. Change into the 'cornfedsipua' directory.

2. Make sure the uninstall script file 'uninstall.sh' is executable. This
   can be done by executing the following command:

   chmod u+x uninstall.sh

3. As root, execute the uninstall script by typing following command:

   ./uninstall.sh
